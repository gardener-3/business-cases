1. Customer Loyalty Program

A local bakery wants to “reward frequent buyers.” They tell you:

Customers should get some kind of discount or reward if they buy often.

The owner is not sure if it should be based on the number of visits, total money spent, or number of items bought.

Your task:
Design and implement a system that can:

Track customers and their purchases.

Apply at least two possible reward strategies (e.g., based on visits, based on spending).

Allow the bakery to switch between strategies easily.
